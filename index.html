        Some of the most memorable Muse songs are: 
        
        <li><strong>Butterflies and hurricanes</strong> 
    Muse fans particularly love this song because it calls straight to the heart. "Change everything you are and everything you were." The song is mainly inspired by the butterfly effect of chaos theory. To make things even more dramatic, the song contains a Rachmaninoff inspired interlude. It is not the first time the band likes to showcase their love for classical music.</li> 
        <li><strong>Hysteria</strong> 
          It takes only a couple of seconds for any rock fan to recognize this song. Everyone expects it during a Muse concert. No matter how many times they play, fanc cannot get enough.</li>
        <li><strong>Dead star</strong> 
          Time for some deep cuts. You might have never heard of this one but trust me you'll never hear anything like it again. This song has been played only at a very few concerts, and if you've heard it live means you are an og fan.</li>
